# theme-rotation.el TODO notes

TODO:
- improve README:
  - discuss similar packages
  - add considerations: warn that themes must already be installed; discuss disabling of themes before loading a new theme to avoid undesirable results (use example of manoj-dark)
- write README as a .org file?
- change :type of theme-rotation-config to alist?
- enable to define default theme, which just disables the previous theme
- instead of always loading themes, check if theme is already loaded, and just enable it?
  - custom-enabled-themes
- check if it is well defined as a minor mode
